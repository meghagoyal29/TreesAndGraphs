# TreesAndGraphs
#Trees and Graphs Based Questions asked in most coveted IT firms
Along with methods which are answers to questions, for each class, there is a main method which can be used to test the code.
For Trees and Graphs, I have included methods serialize and deserialize and  to convert a string to Tree and back. These Methods are present in the TreeUtils.java file.
The method takes in a String with # for null children and levelwise nodes. The deserialize method converts a tree back into the same format.
